# Real-Time-Human-Detection-and-Counting
This project detects and counts people in real-time using Python and OpenCV with live video input from a smartphone via DroidCam. It uses contour detection and a virtual center line to track people entering or exiting an area, updating IN/OUT counts and displaying results on-screen and in a saved video.
